# LangGraph & LangChain Agent Playground

This project is a personal playground for exploring, creating, and experimenting with agentic workflows using [LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph) and [LangChain](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain).

## Project Structure
- **notebooks/**: All Jupyter notebooks for demos, exercises, and experiments.
- **docs/**: Documentation and technical notes (to be added).
- **scripts/**: Python scripts and utilities (to be added).

## About This Repository
This repository is inspired by the Udacity course "Introduction to Agents with LangGraph." It is designed for hands-on learning and prototyping of agent logic, workflows, and integrations with LLMs.

### Key Concepts
- **Agents**: LLM-driven systems that dynamically control execution flow.
- **LangGraph**: Enables flexible, reliable, and visualizable agentic workflows using nodes (functions) and edges (routing logic).
- **LangChain**: Provides modular components for LLMs, tools, and memory, which can be orchestrated by LangGraph.

### Example Workflows
- Sequential data processing with state tracking
- LLM-powered Q&A and task routing
- Multi-node and multi-agent orchestration

Feel free to use, modify, and extend the notebooks and scripts as you learn!
