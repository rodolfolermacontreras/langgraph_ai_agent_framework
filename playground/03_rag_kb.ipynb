    "This notebook teaches you how to build a **Knowledge Base Agent** step by step. By the end, you'll understand:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Programming Basics**: How to work with Python data structures (lists, dictionaries)\n",
    "2. **What is RAG**: How to combine retrieval (searching documents) with generation (LLM answers)\n",
    "3. **Embeddings**: How text is converted to numbers for semantic search\n",
    "4. **Building Agents**: How to create a system that can answer questions using external knowledge\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Problem We're Solving\n",
    "Imagine you have a collection of documents (company policies, technical docs, etc.) and you want to ask questions about them. A basic LLM can't answer because it doesn't have access to your documents. **RAG solves this** by:\n",
    "1. Finding relevant documents (retrieval)\n",
    "2. Giving those documents to the LLM as context (augmentation)\n",
    "3. Having the LLM generate an answer based on that context (generation)\n",
